<h2 align="center">Machine Learning Engineer | AI Systems Developer</h2>

<p align="justify">
I'm a Machine Learning Engineer focused on building scalable, AI-driven solutions that automate complex workflows. My background combines mathematics, computer science, and real-world software engineering — with hands-on experience in both academic research and production systems. I mostly work with Python and C++, and enjoy building custom tools for computer vision, natural language processing, and algorithmic trading.

## About Me

- I specialize in transforming repetitive, manual processes into intelligent, automated systems.
- I enjoy designing backend architectures and AI pipelines that are clean, scalable, and practical.
- I'm passionate about deploying real-world machine learning applications — from OCR agents to fast prediction models and ERP automations.
- Outside of work, I often explore topics like signal processing, geometry, and planetary dynamics — where math meets the cosmos.
- I’ve previously done research on coding theory and quantum error correction, and enjoy keeping one foot in science while shipping real products.
